## ---------- -------------------------------

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

# Assignment Information:

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product
You will be allowed to choose your own project idea to accomplish.

The project idea should only depend on rendering information from arrays of objects.

## Requirements

Commits to github every day since project assignment

A README.md file with explanations of...

All the technologies used with their own individual purposes and which problems they solved of how they made the development of the application easier

Approach taken. Such as why you decided to divide the app in the manner you did, why you created the models you did, and why you made the routes you made.

A link to your deployed application

Installation instructions if someone were to clone the repository into their local computer

Unsolved problems

Problems encountered but solved

Post MVP section where you describe all of the future functionality you plan and want to have in your project in order to progress your skill set

Project must be approved by instructional team during the first 6 days week since date of assignment

If project assigned Saturday then it should be approved BY Thursday
 
## Project planning board used throughout project
Project board has to be used within github. Not from an external site such as Trello.
There should be 5 sections in the project board you use (in this exact order from left to right)
##EMERGENCY: 
These are tasks that may arise through your development cycle. If not completed they will greatly hinder or make the entire application obsolete and non-functional

Completed: 
All the tasks that you have completed throughout your time working on the project

In Progress: 
Any tasks that you are CURRENTLY working with in order to complete your project. Highly recommended that you have no more than 2-3 simultaneous tasks you're working on.

To-do: 
These are all the tasks that you currently see that you need to complete in order to achieve your MVP requirements. But are currently not working with.

Ice-box: 
These are tasks that you should complete at some point but aren't a problem or hurdle as for right now and won't be for a long time. Or at all.


#   README file clearly documents the purpose of the project as a problem statement
 README file clearly documents the target end user for this program.

Git repository has AT LEAST 30 github commits with VERY clear messages
Every message should have a description of the tasks that you accomplished, how, and why you accomplished it the way that you did
There should never be any vague or one word commit messages

Git repository should have branches that were used in order to create the application incrementally.
It is recommended to create a new branch at every feature OR when you have to change a significant amount of code that may or may not affect your application negatively|
Added quite a lot of descriptions in the section where we tell the students that they need to present their projects. So that if we need to we could approve their projects through text and this way we GREATLY reduce the chances that a student or students will get in way over their heads
